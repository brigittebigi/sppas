Summary: 
This paper presents the outline and performance of an automatic 
syllable boundary detection system. The syllabification of phonemes is 
performed with a rule-based system. The proposed phonemes, classes and rules 
are listed in an external configuration file of the tool.

Summary: 
EVALITA is an initiative devoted to the evaluation of Natural Language
Processing and Speech tools for Italian2. In Evalita 2011 the "Forced Alignment 
on Spontaneous Speech" task was added. Training data is about 15 map task 
dialogues recorded by couples of speakers exhibiting a wide variety of Italian 
variants.

Summary: 
During Speech Prosody 2012, we presented SPPAS, SPeech Phonetization 
Alignment and Syllabification, a tool to automatically produce annotations which
include utterance, word, syllabic and phonemic segmentations from a recorded 
speech sound and its transcription. SPPAS is open source software issued under 
the GNU Public License. SPPAS is multi-platform (Linux, MacOS and Windows) and 
it is specifically designed to be used directly by linguists in conjunction 
with other tools for the automatic analysis of speech prosody. 
This paper presents various improvements implemented since the previously
described version.

>**Automatic detection of syllable boundaries in spontaneous speech**,
>Language Resource and Evaluation Conference, pages 3285-3292, La Valetta, Malte.

Summary: 
This paper presents the outline and performance of an automatic 
syllable boundary detection system. The syllabification of phonemes is 
performed with a rule-based system. The proposed phonemes, classes and rules 
are listed in an external configuration file of the tool.

Summary: 
EVALITA is an initiative devoted to the evaluation of Natural Language
Processing and Speech tools for Italian2. In Evalita 2011 the "Forced Alignment 
on Spontaneous Speech" task was added. Training data is about 15 map task 
dialogues recorded by couples of speakers exhibiting a wide variety of Italian 
variants.

Summary: 
During Speech Prosody 2012, we presented SPPAS, SPeech Phonetization 
Alignment and Syllabification, a tool to automatically produce annotations which
include utterance, word, syllabic and phonemic segmentations from a recorded 
speech sound and its transcription. SPPAS is open source software issued under 
the GNU Public License. SPPAS is multi-platform (Linux, MacOS and Windows) and 
it is specifically designed to be used directly by linguists in conjunction 
with other tools for the automatic analysis of speech prosody. 
This paper presents various improvements implemented since the previously
described version.

>**TGA: a web tool for Time Group Analysis**,
> Tools ans Resources for the Analysis of Speech Prosody, Aix-en-Provence, France, pp. 66-69.

Summary:
Speech timing analysis in linguistic phonetics often relies on
annotated data in  de facto  standard formats, such as Praat
TextGrids, and much of the analysis is still done largely by
hand, with spreadsheets, or with specialised scripting (e.g.
Praat scripting), or relies on cooperation with programmers.
The  TGA  (Time   Group   Analyser)   tool   provides   efficient
ubiquitous   web-based   computational   support   for   those
without   such   computational   facilities.   The   input   module
extracts   a   specified   tier   (e.g.   phone,   syllable,   foot)  from
inputs   in   common   formats;   user-defined   settings   permit
selection of sub-sequences such as inter-pausal groups, and
duration   difference   thresholds.   Tabular   outputs   provide
descriptive  statistics (including modified deviation models
like  PIM,  PFD,  nPVI,  rPVI), linear regression, and novel
structural   information   about   duration   patterns,   including
difference n-grams and Time Trees (temporal parse trees).

>9th International conference on Language Resources and Evaluation (LREC), Reykjavik (Iceland), pages 2648-2652. ISBN: 978-2-9517408-8-4.

Summary:
This  paper  investigates  the  discursive  phenomenon  called  other-repetitions  
(OR),  particularly  in  the  context  of  spontaneous  French dialogues. 
It focuses on their automatic detection and characterization. 
A method is proposed to retrieve automatically OR: this detection
is based on rules that are applied on the lexical material only. 
This automatic detection process has been used to label other-repetitions on
8 dialogues of CID - Corpus of Interactional Data. Evaluations performed on 
one speaker are good with a F1-measure of 0.85. Retrieved
OR occurrences are then statistically described: number of words, distance, etc.

>**Representing Multimodal Linguistics Annotated Data**,
>9th International conference on Language Resources and Evaluation (LREC), Reykjavik (Iceland), pages 3386-3392. ISBN: 978-2-9517408-8-4.

Summary:
The question of interoperability for linguistic annotated resources requires to cover different aspects.  First, it requires a representation
framework making it possible to compare, and potentially merge, different annotation schema. In this paper, a general description level
representing the multimodal linguistic annotations is proposed. It focuses on time and data content representation: This paper reconsiders
and enhances the current and generalized representation of annotations.  An XML schema of such annotations is proposed.  A Python
API is also proposed.  This framework is implemented in a multi-platform software and distributed under the terms of the GNU Public
License.

>**A Multilingual Text Normalization Approach**,
>Human Language Technologies Challenges for Computer Science and Linguistics LNAI 8387, Springer, Heidelberg. ISBN: 978-3-319-14120-6. Pages 515-526.

Summary:
The creation of text corpora requires a sequence of processing steps in order 
to constitute, normalize, and then to directly exploit it by a given application. 
This paper presents a generic approach for text normalization and concentrates 
on the aspects of methodology and linguistic engineering, which serve to develop 
a multi-purpose multilingual text corpus. This approach was applied on written 
texts of French, English, Spanish, Vietnamese, Khmer and Chinese and on speech 
transcriptions of French, English, Italian, Chinese and Taiwanese. It consists 
in splitting the text normalization problem in a set of minor sub-problems as 
language-independent as possible. A set of text corpus normalization tools with 
linked resources and a document structuring method are proposed and distributed 
under the terms of the GPL license.

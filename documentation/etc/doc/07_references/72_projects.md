##SPPAS in research projects


###MULTIPHONIA

SPPAS was used to annotate the MULTIPHONIA corpus (MULTImodal 
database of PHONetics teaching methods in classroom InterActions) 
created by Charlotte ALAZARD, Corine ASTESANO, Michel BILLIÈRES.

This database consists of audio-video classroom recording comparing two methods
of phonetic correction (the "traditional" articulatory method, and 
the Verbo-Tonal Method). This database is composed of 96 hours of pronunciation
classes with beginners and advanced students of French as a Foreign Language. 
Every class lasted approximatively 90 minutes. This multimodal database 
constitutes an important resource for Second Language Acquisition's researchers.
Hence, MULTIPHONIA will be enriched at many different levels, to allow for 
segmental, prosodic, morphosyntaxic, syntaxic, lexical and gestural analyses of
L2 speech.

###Amennpro
 
SPPAS was used for the annotation of the French part of the AixOx corpus.

* four way recordings of French and English texts;
* read by English and French speakers;
* non-native speakers were divided into advanced and beginners.

    Remark:
    Some examples are located in the samples-fra directory (files F_F_*.*) and
    in the samples-eng (files E_E*.*).


###Evalita 2011: Italian phonetization and alignment

Evalita 2011 was the third evaluation campaign of Natural Language Processing 
and Speech tools for Italian, supported by the NLP working group of AI*IA 
(Associazione Italiana per l'Intelligenza Artificiale/Italian Association 
for Artificial Intelligence) and AISV (Associazione Italiana di Scienze della 
Voce/Italian Association of Speech Science).
            
SPPAS participated to the Forced Alignment on Spontaneous Speech for both tasks:

* Phone segmentation
* Word segmentation

The corpus was a set of Dialogues, map-tasks:

* 3h30 speech;
* 15% phones are: "sil", filled-pauses, garbage.


###Orthographic Transcription: Impact on Phonetization 

SPPAS Phonetization was evaluated on a French Corpus (MARC-Fr).
SPPAS Alignment was also evaluated on this corpus.

Results are reported in the following publications: 

>*B. Bigi, P. Péri R. Bertrand* (2012).
>**Orthographic Transcription: Which Enrichment is required for Phonetization?**,
>Language Resources and Evaluation Conference, Istanbul (Turkey), May 2012

>*Brigitte Bigi* (2014).

###Cofee: Conversational Feedback 

In a conversation, feedback is mostly performed through short utterances 
produced by another participant than the main current speaker. 
These utterances are among the most frequent in conversational data. 
They are also considered as crucial communicative tools for achieving 
coordination in dialogue. They have been the topic of various descriptive 
studies and often given a central role in applications such as dialogue 
systems. Cofee project addresses this issue from a linguistic viewpoint 
and combines fine-grained corpus analyses of semi- controlled data with 
formal and statistical modelling. 

Cofee is managed by Laurent Prévot: <http://cofee.hypotheses.org/>

Cofee corpora and the use of SPPAS on such corpora is presented in:

>**Jan Gorish, Corine Astésano, Ellen Gurman Bard, Brigitte Bigi, Laurent Prévot** (2014).

###Variamu: Variations in Action: a MUltilingual approach

Variamu is an international collaborative joint project co-funded by Amidex. 
The scientific object of the collaboration is the issue of language variation 
addressed from a comparative perspective.
Speech and language knowledge supports a growing number of strategic domains 
such as Human Language Technologies (HLT), Language Learning (LL), and 
Clinical Linguistics (CL). A crucial issue to these domains is language 
variation, which can result from dysfunction, proficiency, dialectal 
specificities, communicative contexts or even inter-individual differences. 
Variation is often an important part of the question itself.

This network will be structured around 3 research axes, all centered on the 
variation concept:

1. Language technologies,
2. Linguistics and Phonetics,
3. Speech and Language Pathologies.

SPPAS is mainly concerned by the first axe.

The first result of this project is the participation of SPPAS at the
Evalita 2014 campaign, for the FACS task: Forced-Alignment on Children Speech.

The second result of this project is the support of Cantonese into SPPAS, 
thanks to a collaboration with Prof. Tan Lee of the University of Hong Kong.

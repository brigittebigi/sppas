## What is SPPAS?


### Main features

SPPAS - Automatic Annotation of Speech is a scientific computer software
package written and maintained by Brigitte Bigi of
the Laboratoire Parole et Langage, in Aix-en-Provence, France.

Available for free, with open source code, there is simply no other package
for linguists to simple use in automatic segmentation of speech.
SPPAS is daily developed with the aim to provide a robust and reliable
software for the automatic annotation and for the exploitation of
annotated-data.

>This documentation will assume that you are using a relatively recent
>version of SPPAS.

There's no reason not to download the latest version whenever released:
it's easy and fast!

documentation. This documentation is available in-line (see the SPPAS website),
it is also included in the package (in PDF format) and it can also be explored
with the Graphical User Interface by clicking on the 'Help' button.

2. Many problems can be solved by updating the version of SPPAS.

3. There is a SPPAS Users discussion group where queries and allied topics
are discussed, with responses from colleagues or from the author.
Topics can range from elementary "how do I" queries to advanced
issues in scriptwriting. 
There's (or there will be) something there for everybody.
It is recommended to sign up to become a member on the website:

4. If none of the above helps, you may send e-mail to the author. 
It is very important to indicate clearly: 

    1/ your operating system and its version, 
    2/ the version of SPPAS (supposed to be the last one), and 
    3/ for automatic annotations, send the log file, and a sample of the data 
    on which a problem occurs.

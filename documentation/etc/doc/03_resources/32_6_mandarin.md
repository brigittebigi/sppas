##Mandarin Chinese

*(C) Laboratoire Parole et Langage, Aix-en-Provence, France.*

###Pronunciation dictionary

The pronunciation dictionary was manually created for the syllables by Zhi Na.


###Acoustic model

The acoustic model was created by Brigitte Bigi from data recorded at Shanghai
by Zhi Na, and another one by Hongwei Ding. 
We address special thanks to hers for giving us access to the corpus.
These recordings are a Chinese version of the Eurom1 corpus. 
See the following publication for details:

Notice that the current model was trained from a very small amount of data:
this will impact on the results: 
Do not expect to get good performances for the automatic alignment.

**More Mandarin Chinese data are welcome!**

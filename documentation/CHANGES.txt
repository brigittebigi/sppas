=============================================================================
SPPAS 1.4 major changes:
=============================================================================

annotations:
  - add momel: implements momel in python.
    Momel (MOdelling MELody) is an algorithm developed by Daniel Hirst
    and Robert Espesser for the analysis and synthesis of intonation patterns.
    Momel need a .hz files with pitch values (ASCII file with one value each 10ms).
    This Momel implementation can be used directly, with a large set of options:
          > python $SPPAS/scripts/lib/momel.py -h
    or in SPPAS, using the GUI, or in text-mode (only with default options):
          > $SPPAS/sppas.py -i INPUT --momel
  - add the FIRST version of Intsint, proposed by D. Hirst.
    INTSINT is an acronym for INternational Transcription System for INTonation.
    INTSINT codes the intonation of an utterance by means of an alphabet of i
    8 discrete symbols constituting a surface phonological representation of the
    intonation:
       T (Top), H (Higher), U (Upstepped), S (Same),
       M (mid), D (Downstepped), L (Lower), B (Bottom).

<h2 id="what-is-sppas"><a href="#what-is-sppas">What is SPPAS?</a></h2>
<h3 id="overview"><a href="#overview">Overview</a></h3>
<p><strong>SPPAS - the automatic annotation and analyses of speech</strong> is a scientific computer software package written and maintained by Brigitte Bigi of the <a href="http://www.lpl-aix.fr">Laboratoire Parole et Langage</a>, in Aix-en-Provence, France.</p>
<p>SPPAS is daily developed with the aim to provide a robust and reliable software. Available for free, with open source code, there is simply no other package for linguists to simple use in both the automatic annotations of speech and the analyses of any kind of annotated data. You can imagine the annotations or analyses you need, SPPAS does the rest!</p>
<p>As the primary functionality, SPPAS proposes a set of automatic or semi-automatic annotations of recordings. In this context, corpus annotation is &quot;defined as the practice of adding interpretative, linguistic information to an electronic corpus of spoken and/or written language data. 'Annotation' can also refer to the end-product of this process&quot; (Leech, 1997). The annotation of recordings is then concerned by many Linguistics fields as Phonetics, Prosody, Gestures or Discourse... Corpora are annotated with detailed information at various linguistic levels thanks to annotation software. As large multimodal corpora become prevalent, new annotation and analysis requirements are emerging. The annotations must be time-synchronized: annotations need to be time-aligned in order to be useful for purposes such as qualitative or quantitative analyses. Temporal information makes it possible to describe behaviors from different subjects that happen at the same time, and time-analysis of multi-level annotations can reveal linguistic structures. Annotating recordings is very labor-intensive and cost-ineffective since it has to be performed manually by experienced researchers with many hours of work. SPPAS can automatize annotations and allows users to save time. In order to use efficiently this automatic annotation software, a rigorous methodology to collect data and to prepare them is expected. This implies a rigorous framework to ensure compatibilities between annotations and time-saving. The expected result is time-aligned data, for all annotated levels.</p>
<p>Automatic annotations can be used either with a Command-line User Interface or a Graphical User Interface. So, there's no specific difficulty by using this software. Advanced users can also access directly the Application Programming Interface. The program was implemented using the programming language Python 2.7. The only potential brake on the usage of automatic annotations of SPPAS is the need to integrate it in a rigorous methodology for the corpus construction, annotations and analyses.</p>
<p>Linguistics annotation, especially when dealing with multiple domains, makes use of different tools within a given project. In recent years, many annotation software and/or tools have become available for annotation of audio-video data. For a researcher looking for an annotation software, it is difficult to select the most appropriate. Due to the diversity of linguistic phenomena, annotation tools lead to a variety of models, theories and formalisms. This diversity results in heterogeneous description formats, each tool developing its own framework. The choice of the annotation software is part of the annotation framework and must be done carefully and of course before the creation of the corpus. SPPAS annotation files are in a specific XML format with extension <code>xra</code>; and annotations can be imported from and exported to a variety of other formats, including Praat (TextGrid, PitchTier, IntensityTier), Elan (eaf), Transcriber (trs), Annotation Pro (antx), Phonedit (mrk), Sclite (ctm, stm), HTK (lab, mlf), subtitles formats (srt, sub), CSV files...</p>
<p>&quot;[...] when multiple annotations are integrated into a single data set, inter-relationships between the annotations can be explored both qualitatively (by using database queries that combine levels) and quantitatively (by running statistical analyses or machine learning algorithms)&quot; (Chiarcos 2008). As a consequence, some special features are offered in SPPAS for managing corpora of annotated files - of any file format. Among others, it includes a tool to filter multi-levels annotations (Bigi and Saubesty, 2015). Other included tools are dedicated to the analysis of time-aligned data; as for example to estimate descriptive statistics, a version of the Time Group Analyzer (Gibbon 2013), etc.</p>
<p>Data analysis of SPPAS are mainly proposed in the Graphical User Interface. However, advanced users can also access directly the Application Programming Interface, for example to estimate statistics or to manipulate annotated data.</p>

<h3 id="websites"><a href="#websites">Websites</a></h3>
<p>Since January 2016, the main website of SPPAS is located at the following URL:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.sppas.org">http://www.sppas.org</a></p>
<p>The source code with recent stable releases is hosted on github. From this website, anyone can download the current version and the development version. After signed-in, anyone can send comments and/or declare an issue:</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/brigittebigi/sppas">https://github.com/brigittebigi/sppas</a></p>
<h3 id="external-programs"><a href="#external-programs">External programs</a></h3>
<p>On the main website, it is possible to find information about the software requirements. In fact, other programs are required for SPPAS to operate. Of course, they must be installed before using SPPAS, and <em>only once</em>. This operation takes 5 up to 10 minutes depending on the operating system.</p>
<p>The following software are required:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Python 2.7.x</li>
<li>wxPython &gt;= 3.0</li>
<li>julius &gt;= 4.1</li>
</ol>
<p>It is very (very very) important to take care about the version of Python. An installation guide is available on the website, depending on the operating system. <strong>Please, closely follow the instructions.</strong> Notice that administrator rights are required to perform the installations. In case of difficulty arising from the installation of such software, we invite you to consult the web first. It probably will provide the right solution. If, however, the problems were to persist, contact the author by e-mail.</p>
<h3 id="download-and-install-sppas"><a href="#download-and-install-sppas">Download and install SPPAS</a></h3>
<p>The main website contains the <code>Download</code> page to download recent versions. There is a unique version of SPPAS which does not depend on the operating system. The only obvious difference depending on the system is how it looks on the computer screen.</p>
<figure>
<img src="./etc/logos/systemes.jpg" alt="Operating systems" /><figcaption>Operating systems</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>SPPAS is ready to run, so it does not need elaborate installation, except for the other software required for SPPAS to work properly. All you need to do is to copy the SPPAS package from the website to somewhere on your computer. Choose <em>a location with preferably only US-ASCII characters in the name of the path</em>.</p>
<p>The SPPAS package is compressed and zipped, so you will need to <em>decompress and unpack</em> it once you've got it.</p>
<h3 id="the-sppas-package"><a href="#the-sppas-package">The SPPAS package</a></h3>
<p>Unlike many other software tool, SPPAS is not what is called a &quot;black box&quot;. Instead, everything is done so that users can check / change operation. It is particularly suitable for automatic annotations: it allows any user to adapt automatic annotations to its own needs. The package of SPPAS is then a directory with content as files and folders.</p>
<figure>
<img src="./etc/screenshots/explorer-sppas-folder.png" alt="SPPAS Package content" /><figcaption>SPPAS Package content</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The SPPAS package contains:</p>
<ul>
<li>the <code>README.txt</code> file, which aims to be read by users</li>
<li>the files <code>sppas.bat</code> and <code>sppas.command</code> to execute the Graphical User Interface</li>
<li>the <code>resources</code> directory contains data that are used by automatic annotations (lexicons, dictionaries, ...)</li>
<li>the <code>samples</code> directory contains folders of data of various languages, they are sets of annotations freely distributed to test features of SPPAS</li>

</ol>
<h2 id="main-and-important-recommendations"><a href="#main-and-important-recommendations">Main and important recommendations</a></h2>
<h3 id="about-files"><a href="#about-files">About files</a></h3>
<p>There is a list of important things to keep in mind while using SPPAS. They are summarized as follows and detailed in the chapters of this documentation:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Speech audio files:</p>
<ul>
<li>only <code>wav</code> and <code>au</code> files</li>
<li>only mono (= one channel)</li>
<li>frame rates: 16000hz</li>
<li>bit rate: 16 bits</li>
<li>good recording quality is expected. It is obviously required to never convert from a compressed file, as mp3 for example.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Annotated data files:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>UTF-8</em> encoding only</li>
<li>it is recommended to use only US-ASCII characters in file names (including the path)</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<p>Other frame rates and bit rates are accepted: the audio file is converted in 16 bits/16000Hz in a copy of the file then SPPAS is using this latter.</p>
<h3 id="about-automatic-annotations"><a href="#about-automatic-annotations">About automatic annotations</a></h3>
<p>The quality of the results for most of the automatic annotations is highly influenced by <strong>the quality of the data the annotation takes in input</strong>. This is a politically correct way to say: <em>Garbage in, garbage out!</em></p>
<p>Annotations are based on the use of linguistic resources. Resources for several languages are gently shared and freely available in the SPPAS package. The quality of the automatic annotations is largely influenced by <strong>the quality of the linguistic resources</strong>. The users can contribute to improve them.</p>
<h3 id="about-linguistic-resources"><a href="#about-linguistic-resources">About linguistic resources</a></h3>
<p><strong>Users are of crucial importance for resource development</strong>. They can contribute to improve them, and the author releases the improvements to the public, so that the whole community benefits. Resources are distributed under the terms of public licenses, so that SPPAS users are &quot;free&quot;:</p>
<ul>
<li>free to study the source code and the resources of the software they use,</li>
<li>free to share the software and resources with other people,</li>
<li>free to modify the software and resources, and</li>
<li>free to publish their modified versions of the software and resources.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="interoperability-and-compatibility"><a href="#interoperability-and-compatibility">Interoperability and compatibility</a></h2>
<p>In the scope of the compatibility between SPPAS data and annotated data from other software tools or programs, SPPAS is able to open/save and convert files. The conversion of a file to another file is the process of changing the form of the presentation of the data, and not the data itself. Every time, when data file is to be used, they must be converted to a readable format for the next application. A data conversion is normally an automated process to some extent. SPPAS provide the possibility to automatically import and export the work done on some various file formats from a wide range of other software tools. For the users, the visible change will be only a different file extension but for software it is the difference between understanding of the contents of the file and the inability to read it.</p>
<p>The conversion of file formats is then a difficult task and it can imply that some data are left. Representing annotated data in SPPAS is of crucial importance for its automatic annotations, its analysis of annotations and for the software to be able to automatically annotate and analyze any kind of data files. SPPAS then includes an original and generic enough annotation representation framework. This framework for annotations is very rich and contain several information like alternative labels or alternative localizations of annotations, a tier hierarchy, controlled vocabularies, etc. A native format named XRA was then developed to fit in such data representation. The physical level of representation of XRA obviously makes use of XML, XML-related standards and stand-off annotation. Due to an intuitive naming convention, XRA documents are human readable as far as possible within the limits of XML.</p>
<p>SPPAS makes use of its internal data representation to convert files. A conversion then consists of two steps: First, the incoming file is loaded and mapped to the SPPAS data framework; and second, such data is saved to the expected format. These two steps are applied whatever the organization structure of annotations in the original or in the destination file format. This process allows SPPAS to import from and export to a variety of file formats. This is illustrated by the next Figure which includes the list of file formats and the corresponding software that are supported. Arrows are representing the following actions:</p>
<ul>
<li>import from, represented by a continued line with an arrow from the file format to the SPPAS framework;</li>
<li>partially import from, represented by a dash line with an arrow from the file format to the SPPAS framework;</li>
<li>export to, represented by an arrow from the SPPAS framework to the file format.</li>
</ul>

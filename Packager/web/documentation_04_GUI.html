<h1 id="graphical-user-interface---gui">Graphical User Interface - GUI</h1>
<h2 id="getting-started">Getting started</h2>
<p>The current chapter describes how to use the Graphical User Interface.</p>
<p>Under Windows, once the SPPAS package is opened in the File Explorer, <em>double-click on the <code>sppas.bat</code> file</em>.</p>
<p>Under MacOS or Linux, once the SPPAS package is opened in the Finder/File Explorer, <em>double-click on the <code>sppas.command</code> file</em>. The program will first check the version of wxpython and eventually ask to update.</p>
<p>Then, two windows will open automatically.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Above, a window with a tips aims at displaying messages to help users to discover SPPAS capabilities.</p></li>
<li><p>Below, the main frame: to perform automatic annotations, get statistics, filter data, view wav/annotated data, etc.</p></li>
</ol>
<h3 id="the-tips-frame">The Tips Frame</h3>
<p>This frame picks up randomly and prints a message to help users. Click on the button <code>Next Tip</code> to read another message, or click on the <code>Close</code> button to close the frame.</p>
<figure>
<img src="./etc/screenshots/tips.png" alt="The Tips Frame" /><figcaption>The Tips Frame</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The <code>Settings</code> frame also allows to show/hide the Tips frame at start-up.</p>
<p>If you want to suggest new tips (to help the other users), send them by e-mail to the author at <code>brigitte.bigi@gmail.com</code>. They will be included in the next version.</p>
<h3 id="the-main-frame">The main frame</h3>
<p>The main frame is made of a menu, a toolbar and the main content. All of them are described in the next sub-sections.</p>
<figure>
<img src="./etc/screenshots/sppas-1-6-7.png" alt="The Main Frame of version 1.6.7" /><figcaption>The Main Frame of version 1.6.7</figcaption>
</figure>
<h4 id="the-menu">The menu</h4>
<p>It allows to access to all functions of the GUI, and to manage it.</p>
<p>The &quot;File&quot; menu can be used to manage files (add, remove, ...) and to exit the program.</p>
<p>In the &quot;Preferences&quot; menu, check boxes allow to show/hide the toolbar and the status bar, and to fix settings (see below for details).</p>
<p>Since version 1.6.6, the &quot;Help&quot; menu includes an item to open the SPPAS website in a web browser, to access inline documentation, to declare a bug and to send feedback to the author. In the latter case, replace the text &quot;Describe what you did here...&quot; by your own comment, question or suggestion and choose how to send the e-mail: with your own default mailer, with gmail (opened in your web browser) or by another e-mail client. Then, close the frame by clicking on the &quot;Close&quot; button.</p>
<figure>
<img src="./etc/screenshots/feedback.png" alt="The Feedback Frame" /><figcaption>The Feedback Frame</figcaption>
</figure>
<h4 id="the-toolbar">The toolbar</h4>
<p>The toolbar includes 5 buttons:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Exit;</li>
<li>Settings;</li>
<li>Plug-in;</li>
<li>About;</li>
<li>Help.</li>
</ol>
<p>The look of the toolbar can change depending of the Theme of the icons.</p>

<figure>
<img src="./etc/screenshots/toolbar-crystalclear.png" alt="Main toolbar, with CrystalClear icon theme" /><figcaption>Main toolbar, with CrystalClear icon theme</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The <code>Exit</code> button closes all SPPAS frames <em>properly</em>. Please, do not kill SPPAS by clicking on the arrow of the windows manager! <strong>Use this Exit button</strong> to close SPPAS.</p>
<p>To fix new settings, click on the <code>Settings</code> icon, then choose your preferred options:</p>
<ul>
<li>General: fix background colour, font colour and font of the GUI, and enable/disable tips at start-up.</li>
<li>Theme: fix the icons of the GUI.</li>
<li>Annotations: fix automatic annotations parameters.</li>
</ul>
<figure>
<img src="./etc/screenshots/settings.png" alt="Settings is used to manage user preferences" /><figcaption>Settings is used to manage user preferences</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The Settings can be saved in a file to be used each time SPPAS is executed. To close the frame, click on:</p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;Cancel&quot; button to ignore changes,</li>
<li>&quot;Close&quot; to apply changes then close the frame.</li>
</ul>
<p>The <code>Plug-in</code> button allows to install a new plugin.</p>
<p>The <code>About</code> button opens a new frame which gives the main information about SPPAS: authors, license, web site URL, etc.</p>
<p>The <code>Help</code> button opens the documentation and allows to browse in the chapters and sections.</p>
<figure>
<img src="./etc/screenshots/helpbrowser.png" alt="The Help Browser Frame" /><figcaption>The Help Browser Frame</figcaption>
</figure>
<h4 id="the-content-of-the-frame.">The content of the frame.</h4>
<p>The content of the main frame is made of 4 main panels:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>the file list panel (FLP), at left;</li>
<li>the automatic annotation panel (AAP); at middle-top;</li>
<li>the components panel (CCP), at middle-bottom;</li>
<li>the plug-ins panel (P&amp;P), at right.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="file-list-panel">File List Panel</h2>
<p>The File List Panel (FLP) consists of:</p>
<ul>
<li>a file explorer: a tree-style set of files and directories.</li>
<li>at top, a toolbar: a set of buttons to perform actions.</li>
</ul>
<figure>
<img src="./etc/screenshots/FLP.png" alt="File List Panel (FLP)" /><figcaption>File List Panel (FLP)</figcaption>
</figure>
<h3 id="the-file-explorer">The file explorer</h3>
<p>The list contains Directories and Files the user added, but only files that SPPAS can deal with (depending on the file extension).</p>
<p>To select:</p>
<ul>
<li>a single click on a file name highlights and selects the chosen file (displayed in the list).</li>
<li>a single click on a directory name highlights and selects the chosen directory (displayed in the list).</li>
</ul>
<p>Like in any other file explorer, while clicking and pressing the &quot;CTRL&quot; key (&quot;COMMAND&quot; on MacOS) on the keyboard, you can select multiple files and/or directories. Idem with the &quot;SHIFT&quot; key.</p>
<h3 id="the-toolbar-1">The toolbar</h3>
<h4 id="add-files.">Add file(s).</h4>
<p>A single-click on the <code>Add File</code> button opens a frame that allows to select the files to get. By default, only &quot;wav&quot; files are proposed. If you select <em>a wav file(s)</em>, all files with the same name will be automatically added into the file explorer. It is possible to change the wildcard of this frame and to select each file to add. In both cases, only files with an appropriate extension will be added in the file explorer.</p>
<figure>
<img src="./etc/screenshots/FLP-Add.png" alt="Adding specific files" /><figcaption>Adding specific files</figcaption>
</figure>
<blockquote>
<p>Remark: The files are added in the list, but they are not opened.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="add-a-directory.">Add a directory.</h4>
<p>A single-click on the <code>Add Dir</code> button opens a frame that allows to select the directory to get. Each wav file, and all related files (i.e. with the same name and with an appropriate extension) will be added into the file explorer.</p>
<h4 id="remove-files.">Remove file(s).</h4>
<p>A single-click on the <code>Remove</code> button removes the selected files/directories.</p>
<p>Notice that files are not deleted from the disk, they are just removed of the FLP.</p>
<h4 id="delete-files.">Delete file(s).</h4>
<p>A single-click on the <code>Delete</code> button deletes definitively the selected files/directories of your computer, and remove them of the FLP. Notice that there is no way to get them back!</p>
<p>A dialogue frame will open, and you'll have to confirm or cancel the definitive file(s) deletion.</p>
<h4 id="copy-files.">Copy file(s).</h4>
<p>A single-click on the <code>Copy</code> button allows to copy the selected file(s), change their name and/or change the location (eventually, change the file extension).</p>
<h4 id="export-files.">Export file(s).</h4>
<p>Export annotated files in an other format (csv, txt, ...):</p>
<figure>
<img src="./etc/screenshots/FLP-Export.png" alt="Export: Check the expected format in the list" /><figcaption>Export: Check the expected format in the list</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>After the export, a new frame will open to report if file(s) were exported successfully or not.</p>
<h2 id="automatic-annotations-panel">Automatic Annotations Panel</h2>
<h3 id="description">Description</h3>
<p>The Automatic Annotations Panel (AAP) consists of a list of buttons to check (the left column), the annotation name (middle) and buttons to fix the language of each annotation (at right).</p>
<figure>
<img src="./etc/screenshots/AAP.png" alt="Automatic Annotations Panel (AAP)" /><figcaption>Automatic Annotations Panel (AAP)</figcaption>
</figure>
<h3 id="aap-usage">AAP Usage</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Remark: to understand what each annotation is for, please refer to the chapter &quot;Automatic Speech Segmentation and Annotation&quot; of this document.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Select each annotation to perform. Each annotation can be configured by clicking on the annotation name.</p></li>
<li><p>Select the language for all annotations, or for each one independently by clicking on the &quot;chains&quot; button.</p></li>
<li><p>Click on the <em>Annotate</em> button... and wait! Please, wait! Particularly for Tokenization or Phonetization: loading resources (lexicons or dictionaries) is very long. Sometimes, the progress bar does not really &quot;progress&quot;...it depends on the system. So, just wait!</p></li>
<li><p>It is important <strong>to read the Procedure Outcome report</strong> to check that everything happened normally during the automatic process.</p></li>
</ol>
<h3 id="the-procedure-outcome-report">The procedure outcome report</h3>
<p>It is very important to read conscientiously this report: it mentions exactly what happened during the automatic annotation process. This text can be saved: it is recommended to be kept it with the related data because it contains information that are interesting to know for anyone using the annotations!</p>
<p>The text first indicates the version of SPPAS that was used. This information is very important, mainly because annotations in SPPAS and their related resources are regularly improved and then, the result of the automatic process can change from one version to the other one.</p>
<p>Secondly, the text mentions information related to the given input:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>the selected language of each annotation, only if the annotation is language-dependent). For some language-dependent annotations, SPPAS can still perform the annotation even if the resources for a given language are not available: in that case, select &quot;und&quot;, which is the iso639-3 code for &quot;undetermined&quot;.</li>
<li>the list of files to be annotated;</li>
<li>the list of annotations and if each annotation was activated or disabled. In that case, activated means that the checkbox of the AAP was checked by the user and that the resources are available for the given language. On the contrary, disabled means that either the checkbox of the AAP was not checked or the required resources are not available.</li>
</ol>
<p>In the following, each automatic annotation is described in details, for each annotated file. Three levels of information must draw your attention:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>&quot;[ OK ]&quot; means that everything happened normally. The annotation was performed successfully.</li>
<li>&quot;[ WARNING ]&quot; means that something happened abnormally, but SPPAS found a solution, and the annotation was still performed successfully.</li>
<li>&quot;[ ERROR ]&quot; means that something happened abnormally, and SPPAS failed to found a solution. The annotation was either not performed, or performed with a bad result.</li>
</ol>
<p>Finally, the &quot;Result statistics&quot; section mentions the number of files that was annotated for each step, or -1 if the annotation was disabled.</p>
<figure>
<img src="./etc/screenshots/log.png" alt="Procedure outcome report" /><figcaption>Procedure outcome report</figcaption>
</figure>
<h2 id="components-panel">Components Panel</h2>
<p>The components are useful for the analysis of annotated files: display the automatic alignments with the audio signal, estimates statistics on the annotations, filter the annotated data to get only the annotations you are interested in, etc.</p>
<p>To execute a specific component, select file(s) in the file explorer, then click on the button of a component. It will open the component frame, and add the selected file(s) in the file manager of the component. Refer to the documentation of each component to know how to use it.</p>
<figure>
<img src="./etc/screenshots/CCP.png" alt="Component Panel (CCP)" /><figcaption>Component Panel (CCP)</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Six components are available:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><code>DataRoamer</code> allows to explore the annotated files: cut/copy/paste/rename/duplicate tiers, move a tier from one file to another one, etc.</li>
<li><code>SndPlayer</code> allows to play your speech files.</li>
<li><code>IPUscribe</code> is useful to perform manual orthographic transcription.</li>
<li><code>SppasEdit</code> displays speech files and annotated files, and is very useful to take a screenshot! Easy way to zoom/scroll, change colours, choose the tiers to display, etc;</li>
<li><code>DataFilter</code> allows to select annotations: fix a set of filters to create new tiers with only the annotations you are interested in!</li>
<li><code>Statistics</code> estimates the number of occurrences, the duration, etc. of the annotations, and allows to save in CSV (for Excel, OpenOffice, R, MatLab,...).</li>
</ol>
<p>All of the components share the same style:</p>
<ul>
<li>a menu, a toolbar</li>
<li>at left: the list of files</li>
<li>at right: a notebook to open files in tabs.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="the-main-toolbar">The main toolbar</h3>
<figure>
<img src="./etc/screenshots/components-toolbar.png" alt="The toolbar of the components" /><figcaption>The toolbar of the components</figcaption>

<li>Exit: go out of the component;</li>
<li>Add: add file(s) in the list;</li>
<li>Remove: remove all un-checked (i.e. un-used) files of the list;</li>
<li>New tab: open an empty new tab in the notebook;</li>
<li>Close tab: close the selected tab;</li>
<li>Settings: the same that the main frame of SPPAS;</li>

</figure>
<h3 id="datafilter">DataFilter</h3>
<p><code>DataFilter</code> allows to select annotations: fix a set of filters to create new tiers with only the annotations you are interested in! This system is based on the creation of 2 different types of filters:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>single filters, i.e. search in a/several tier(s) depending on the data content, the time values or the duration of each annotation;</li>
<li>relation filters, i.e. search on annotations of a/several tier(s) in time-relation with annotations of another one.</li>
</ol>
<p>These later are applied on tiers of many kind of input files (TextGrid, eaf, trs, csv...). The filtering process results in a new tier, that can re-filtered and so on.</p>
<figure>
<img src="./etc/screenshots/DataFilter.png" alt="Component: DataFilter" /><figcaption>Component: DataFilter</figcaption>
</figure>
<h4 id="filtering-annotations-of-a-tier-singlefilter">Filtering annotations of a tier: SingleFilter</h4>
<p>Pattern selection is an important part to extract data of a corpus and is obviously and important part of any filtering system. Thus, if the label of an annotation is a string, the following filters are proposed in DataFilter:</p>
<ul>
<li>exact match: an annotation is selected if its label strictly corresponds to the given pattern;</li>
<li>contains: an annotation is selected if its label contains the given pattern;</li>
<li>starts with: an annotation is selected if its label starts with the given pattern;</li>
<li>ends with: an annotation is selected if its label ends with the given pattern.</li>
</ul>
<p>All these matches can be reversed to represent respectively: does not exactly match, does not contain, does not start with or does not end with. Moreover, this pattern matching can be case sensitive or not.</p>
<p>For complex search, a selection based on regular expressions is available for advanced users.</p>
<p>A multiple pattern selection can be expressed in both ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>enter multiple patterns at the same time (separated by commas) to mention the system to retrieve either one pattern or the other, etc.</li>
<li>enter one pattern at a time and choose the appropriate button: &quot;Apply All&quot; or &quot;Apply any&quot;.</li>
</ul>
<figure>
<img src="./etc/screenshots/DataFilter-label.png" alt="Frame to create a filter on annotation labels. In that case, filtering annotations that exactly match either a, @ or E" /><figcaption>Frame to create a filter on annotation labels. In that case, filtering annotations that exactly match either a, @ or E</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Another important feature for a filtering system is the possibility to retrieve annotated data of a certain duration, and in a certain range of time in the timeline.</p>
<figure>
<img src="./etc/screenshots/DataFilter-duration.png" alt="Frame to create a filter on annotation durations. In that case, filtering annotations that are during more that 80 ms" /><figcaption>Frame to create a filter on annotation durations. In that case, filtering annotations that are during more that 80 ms</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Search can also starts and/or ends at specific time values in a tier.</p>
<figure>
<img src="./etc/screenshots/DataFilter-time.png" alt="Frame to create a filter on annotation time values. In that case, filtering annotations that are starting after the 5th minute." /><figcaption>Frame to create a filter on annotation time values. In that case, filtering annotations that are starting after the 5th minute.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>All the given filters are then summarized in the &quot;SingleFilter&quot; frame. To complete the filtering process, it must be clicked on one of the apply buttons and the new resulting tiers are added in the annotation file(s).</p>
<p>In the given example:</p>
<ul>
<li>click on &quot;Apply All&quot; to get either a, @ or E vowels during more than 80ms, after the 5th minute.</li>
<li>click on &quot;Apply Any&quot; to get a, @ or E vowels, and all annotations during more than 80 ms, and all annotations after the 5th minute.</li>
</ul>
<figure>

</figure>
<h4 id="filtering-on-time-relations-between-two-tiers">Filtering on time-relations between two tiers</h4>
<p>Regarding the searching problem, linguists are typically interested in locating patterns on specific tiers, with the possibility to relate different annotations a tier from another. The proposed system offers a powerful way to request/extract data, with the help of Allen's interval algebra.</p>
<p>In 1983 James F. Allen published a paper in which he proposed 13 basic relations between time intervals that are distinct, exhaustive, and qualitative:</p>
<ul>
<li>distinct because no pair of definite intervals can be related by more than one of the relationships;</li>
<li>exhaustive because any pair of definite intervals are described by one of the relations;</li>
<li>qualitative (rather than quantitative) because no numeric time spans are considered.</li>
</ul>
<p>These relations and the operations on them form Allen's interval algebra. These relations were extended to Interval-Tiers as Point-Tiers to be used to find/select/filter annotations of any kind of time-aligned tiers.</p>
<p>For the sake of simplicity, only the 13 relations of the Allen's algebra are available in the GUI. But actually, we implemented the 25 relations proposed Pujari and al. (1999) in the INDU model. This model is fixing constraints on INtervals (with Allen's relations) and on DUration (duration are equals, one is less/greater than the other). Such relations are available while requesting with Python.</p>
<p>At a first stage, the user must select the tiers to be filtered and click on &quot;RelationFilter&quot;. The second stage is to select the tier that will be used for time-relations.</p>

</figure>
<p>The next step consists in checking the Allen's relations that will be applied. The last stage is to fix the name of the resulting tier. The above screenshots illustrates how to select the first phoneme of each token, except for tokens that are containing only one phoneme (in this later case, the &quot;equal&quot; relation should be checked).</p>

<p>To complete the filtering process, it must be clicked on the &quot;Apply&quot; button and the new resulting tiers are added in the annotation file(s).</p>
<h3 id="statistics">Statistics</h3>
<p><code>Statistics</code> allows to get descriptives statistics about a set of selected tiers. It will allow soon to estimate a user agreement rate (Kappa as a first stage) and will includes TGA (Time Group Analyzer), available at <a href="http://wwwhomes.uni-bielefeld.de/gibbon/TGA/">http://wwwhomes.uni-bielefeld.de/gibbon/TGA/</a>, a tool developped by D. Gibbon, emeritus professor of English and General Linguistics at Bielefeld University.</p>

<h4 id="descriptive-statistics">Descriptive statistics</h4>
<p>It allows to estimate the number of occurrences, the duration, etc. of the annotations of a set of selected tiers, and allows to save in CSV (for Excel, OpenOffice, R, MatLab,...). It offers a serie of sheets organized in a notebook. The first tab is displaying a summary of descriptive statistics of the set of given tiers. The other tabs are indicating one of the statistics over the given tiers. The followings are estimated:</p>
<ul>
<li>occurrences: the number of observations</li>
<li>total durations: the sum of the durations</li>
<li>mean durations: the arithmetic mean of the duration</li>
<li>median durations: the median value of the distribution of durations</li>
<li>std dev. durations: the standard deviation value of the distribution of durations</li>
</ul>
<p>All of them can be estimated on a single annotation label or on a serie of them. The lengh of this context can be optionally changed while fixing the &quot;N-gram&quot; value (available from 1 to 5), just above the sheets.</p>
<p>Each displayed sheet can be saved as a CSV file, which is a useful file format to be read by R, Excel, OpenOffice, LibreOffice, and so... To do so, display the sheet you want to save and click on the button &quot;Save sheet&quot;, just below the sheets. If you plan to open this CSV file with Excel under Windows, it is recommended to change the encoding to UTF-16. For the other cases, UTF-8 is probably the most relevant.</p>
<p>The annotation durations are commonly estimated on the Midpoint value, without taking the radius into account; see (Bigi et al, 2012) for explanations about the Midpoint/Radius. Optionnally, the duration can either be estimated by taking the vagueness into account, then check &quot;Add the radius value&quot; button, or by ignoring the vagueness and estimating only on the central part of the annotation, then check &quot;Deduct the radius value&quot;.</p>
<p>For those who are estimating statistics on XRA files, you can either estimate stats only on the best label (the label with the higher score) or on all labels, i.e. the best label and all its alternatives (if any).</p>

<h3 id="installing-a-plugin">Installing a Plugin</h3>
<p>To install a plugin, follow this workflow:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Download and unpack the Plugin package in a new folder (this folder will be removed after the plugin installation).</li>
<li>Execute SPPAS.</li>
<li>Click on the 'Plugin' icon of the toolbar: it will open a new frame.</li>
<li>Indicate the folder of the new Plugin in the text entry.</li>
<li>Follow the Plugin instructions (if any).</li>
<li>See the new Plugin icon in the Plugins panel of the main frame.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="marsatag-plugin">Marsatag-Plugin</h3>
<p>MarsaTag-Plugin is a plugin to use the French POS-tagger <em>MarsaTag</em> directly from SPPAS. Using this plugin offers two main advantages:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>the POS-Tags are time-aligned; and</li>
<li>MarsaTag is ready-to-use: all steps to execute MarsaTag are pre-configured.</li>
</ol>
<p>Notice that you must install MarsaTag first: <a href="http://sldr.org/sldr000841">http://sldr.org/sldr000841</a></p>
<h3 id="tiermapping">TierMapping</h3>
<p>This plugin allows to create new tiers by mapping the labels of an existing tier, with new labels. Some mapping-tables are included in the plugin:</p>
<ul>
<li>map the phonemes of the tier &quot;PhonAlign&quot; from SAMPA to IPA,</li>
<li>map the phonemes of the tier &quot;PhonAlign&quot; to their articulatory properties.</li>
</ul>
<p>Furthermore, any user can easily create a mapping table. The only requirements are that all tables must be UTF-8 encoded in a CSV file, with columns separated by semi-columns. These tables can be imported/modified/saved with OpenOffice, LibreOffice, Excel, ... The most important is to not change its properties (UTF8, semi-columns) and location (inside the <code>resources</code> directory of the plug-in directory).</p>

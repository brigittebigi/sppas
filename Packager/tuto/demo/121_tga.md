-----------------------------

### the Time Group Analyzer

- proposed by D. Gibbon and implemented into DataStats of SPPAS
- Time Group Analysis requires syllables
- Each line of the displayed gris are the results of a Time Group
- The "Means" tab displays information of each file
- The "Delta Duration" tab compares the duration of each syllable with the previous one
- TGA results can be exported as an annotated file
- TGA results can be saved in a CSV file

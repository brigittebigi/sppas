## About the author

* SPPAS is a scientific computer software package written and maintained
by Brigitte Bigi.

* I'm a CNRS researcher at the Laboratoire Parole et Langage, 
in Aix-en-Provence, France..

* My current research topics are related to:
    
    1. Multimodal corpora
    2. Multilinguality.

## Corpus and annotation

* Corpus linguistics is the study of language as expressed in samples (corpora) of "real world".
* Corpus annotation is a path to greater linguistic understanding.

> Corpus annotation “can be defined as the practice of adding interpretative,
   linguistic information to an electronic corpus of spoken and/or written language data.
   'Annotation' can also refer to the end-product of this process” (Leech, 1997).

-------------------------------

## Annotations

* Annotation is not an end in itself - it is a basis for further analyses.
* Annotations must be time-synchronized: 
    - annotations need to be time-aligned in order to be useful for purposes such as qualitative or quantitative analyses.
* Temporal information makes it possible to describe simultaneous behaviours: 
    - of different levels in an utterance (e.g. prosody and locution);
    - of different modalities (e.g. speech and gesture);
    - of different speakers or extralinguistic events.

## Time-synchronized annotations

## Annotation software

* Manual annotation
    - Audacity;
    - Praat;
    - Elan;
    - Anvil;
    - Winpitch;
    - ...
* Automatic annotation:
    - The current state-of-the-art in Computational Linguistics allows many 
annotation tasks to be semi- or fully- automated.

-------------------------------

## Automatic annotation

* Each annotation that *can* be done automatically *must* be done automatically!

* Why? Because *revising* is faster and easier than *annotating*...
if the automatic system is "good enough".

> Before using any automatic annotation tool/software, 
  it is important to consider its error rate (where applicable) 
  and to estimate how those errors will affect the purpose
  for the annotated corpora.

-------------------------------

## My researches related to SPPAS...

* I'm a computer scientist
* Reseach focus: automatic annotations for Linguistics (phonetic, prosody, discourse)
* Main theoretical approach: methods as language-independent as possible:
    * language independent algorithms;
    * language-dependent resources;
    * easy and fast to add a new language;
    * easy and fast to modify existing resources;
* Second theoretical approach: the possibility to adapt technologies to low-resourced languages.

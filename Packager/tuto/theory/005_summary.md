# Conclusion

-------------------------------

## Multi-Lingual approaches to the automatic annotation of speech

* All the methods are implemented into SPPAS
* SPPAS is a computer software tool designed and developed to handle multiple
language corpora and/or tasks with the same algorithms in the same software
environment.
* SPPAS emphasizes new practices in the methodology of tool developments:
    - considering problems with a generic multi-lingual aspect, 
    - sharing resources, 
    - putting the end-users in control of their own computing.
* Only the resources are language-specific and the approach is based on the 
simplest resources possible.

-------------------------

## Resources extend

* Phoneticians are of crucial importance for resource development
    - they can contribute to improve the resources used by automatic systems. 
* New versions are systematically released to the public and serve to benefit of the whole community. 

-------------------------

## Resources extend (continued)

* Resources are distributed under the terms of a public license, so that SPPAS users:
    - have free access to the application source code and the resources of the software they use, 
    - are free to share the software and resources with other people, 
    - are free to modify the software and resources,
    - are free to publish their modified versions of the software and resources.

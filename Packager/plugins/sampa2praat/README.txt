brief:      SPPAS plugin to convert SAMPA into Praat phonemes encoding.

The Sampa2Praat plugin allows you to convert transcriptions between the SAMPA annotation and the Praat codings of the International Phonetic Alphabet, in either direction. Select a TextGrid in the object window then choose Sampa2Praat from the dynamic menu.
It can convert either individual phonemes or strings of phonemes (syllables, words, â€¦).
The converted transcription can either replace the original or be placed in a new tier.
Any symbols in the transcription tier which are not in the conversion file are replaced by /*/.

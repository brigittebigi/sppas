brief:      SPPAS plugin to convert SAMPA into Praat phonemes encoding.

This plugin allows to convert transcriptions between the SAMPA (Speech
Assessment Methods Phonetic Alphabet) annotation and the Praat codings
of the International Phonetic Alphabet.

It can convert either individual phonemes or strings of phonemes (syllables,
words, ...). The converted transcription is saved in a new file.
Any symbols in the transcription tier which are not in the conversion file
are not replaced.

Changes:

Version 1.0:
    - first version, compatibility with SPPAS-1.8.2 only.
Version 1.1:
    - compatibility: from SPPAS-1.8.3.

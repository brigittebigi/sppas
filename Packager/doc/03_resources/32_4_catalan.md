###Pronunciation Dictionary

The Catalan dictionary is under the terms of the "GNU Public License".

The catalan pronunciation dictionary was downloaded from the Ralf catalog
of dictionaries for the Simon ASR system at 
<http://spirit.blau.in/simon/import-pls-dictionary/>. 
It was then converted (format and phoneset) by Brigitte Bigi. 
Some new words were also added and phonetized manually.

The acoustic model was *not* trained from data. Monophones of other models were
cut and pasted to create this one. 

Here is the phoneset used in the acoustic model:

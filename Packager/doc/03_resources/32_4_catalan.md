#### Pronunciation dictionary

*GNU Public License*

The catalan pronunciation dictionary was downloaded from the Ralf catalog
of dictionaries for the Simon ASR system at
<http://spirit.blau.in/simon/import-pls-dictionary/>.
It was then converted (format and phoneset) by Brigitte Bigi.
Some new words were also added and phonetized manually.

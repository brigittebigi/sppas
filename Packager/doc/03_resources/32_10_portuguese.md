###Pronunciation Dictionary

The Portuguese dictionary is under the terms of the "GNU Public License", v3.

The Portuguese pronunciation dictionary was downloaded from the Ralf catalog
of dictionaries for the Simon ASR system at
<http://spirit.blau.in/simon/import-pls-dictionary/>.
It was then converted (format and phoneset) and corrected by Brigitte Bigi.


###Acoustic Model

The acoustic model was *not* trained from data. Monophones of other models were
cut and pasted to create this one, maily the Spanish and French models.

Here is the phoneset used in the acoustic model:

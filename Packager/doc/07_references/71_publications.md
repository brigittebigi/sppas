#### Summary

The first step of most acoustic analyses unavoidably involves the alignment of
recorded speech sounds with their phonetic annotation. This step is very
labor-intensive and cost-ineffective since it has to be performed manually by
experienced phoneticians during many hours of work.

This paper describes the main features of SPPAS, a software tool designed for
the needs of automatically producing annotations of speech at the level of
utterance, word, syllable and phoneme based on the recorded speech sound and
its orthographic transcription. In other words, it can automatize the phonetic
transcription task for speech materials, as well as the alignment task of
transcription with speech recordings for further acoustic analyses.

Special attention will be given to the methodology implemented in SPPAS, based
on algorithms which are as language-and-task-independent as possible. This
procedure allows for the addition of new languages quickly and for the
adaptation of this tool to the user's specific needs. Consequently, the
quality of the automatic annotations is largely influenced by external
resources, and the users can modify the process as needed. In that sense,
phoneticians need automatic tools and these tools can be significantly
improved by phonetician input.

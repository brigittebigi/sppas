## Getting started

The current chapter describes how to use the Graphical User Interface.

Under Windows, once the SPPAS package is opened in the File Explorer,
*double-click on the `sppas.bat` file*.

Under MacOS or Linux, once the SPPAS package is opened in the 
Finder/File Explorer, *double-click on the `sppas.command` file*. The program
will first check the version of wxpython and eventually ask to update.

Then, the main windows will open automatically. It is made of a menu, a title, 
the tips, the list of files and the action buttons.

### The tips

![The tips included in the main frame](./etc/screenshots/tips.png)

The frame includes message tips that are picked up randomly and printed to 
help users. Click on the button `Next Tip` to read another message, or click 
on the top-left button to close the tips frame. 
The `Settings` allows to show/hide tips at start-up.
If a user wants to suggest new tips to help the other users, they have to be
sent to the author by e-mail. They will be included in the next version.


### The menu

It allows to exit the program, declare an issue and contact the author.

The `Exit` button closes all SPPAS frames *properly*. 
Please, do not kill SPPAS by clicking on the arrow of the windows manager!
**Use this Exit button** to close SPPAS. 

To declare an issue, click on the bug button of the menu, then your default
web browser will be opened at the appropriate URL to do this.

To contact the author, replace the text "Describe what you did here..." by 
your own comment, question or suggestion and choose how to send the e-mail: 
with your own default mailer, with gmail (opened in your web browser)
or by another e-mail client. Then, close the frame by clicking on the "Close"
button.

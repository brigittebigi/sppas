It was then converted (format and phoneset) and corrected by Brigitte Bigi.

The acoustic model was *not* trained from data. Monophones of other models were
cut and pasted to create this one, maily the Spanish and French models.

**Portuguese data are welcome!**
Because data implies a better acoustic model then better alignments...

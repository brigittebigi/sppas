## AudioRoamer

`AudioRoamer` allows to play audio files, to display general information about
a digitalized audio-PCM file and to manipulate the file.

Pulse-code modulation (PCM) is a method used to digitally represent sampled 
analog signals. In a PCM stream, the amplitude of the analog signal is sampled 
regularly at uniform intervals. A PCM stream has two basic properties that 
determine the stream's fidelity to the original analog signal: 

1. the sampling rate, which is the number of times per second that samples 
   are taken; 
2. the bit depth, which determines the number of possible digital values that
   can be used to represent each sample.

Common sampling frequencies are 48 kHz as used with DVD format videos, or 
44.1 kHz that was used in Compact discs. Common sample depths is 16 bits per 
sample: it allows values to range from -32768 to 32767.

Support for multichannel audio depends on file format and relies on 
interweaving or synchronization of streams.

When an audio file is checked in the list of files, a new page is opened in
the notebook. The main information about the audio file are then displayed
in the panel at the middle and a player is displayed at bottom. The audio
file is not loaded in memory, so event very long audio files can be 
displayed.
At the top of the page, a button "Want more?" can be clicked: the audio 
file will then be fully read and analyzed, then a new window will be 
opened to display detailed information. It will also allow to change some
properties of the audio file, extract a channel, etc. 



### Properties of the audio file

The main properties of any audio file are displayed. SPPAS can open audio files
of type "Waveform Audio" file format (WAVE), a Microsoft and IBM audio file format
standard and "SunAu" file format, an audio file format introduced by Sun Microsystems.
The following information are extracted or deducted of the header of the 
audio file:

- the duration given in seconds with a maximum of 3 digits;
- the frame rate given in Hz;
- the sample width in bits (one of 8, 16, 24 or 32);
- the number of channels.


A color code is used to indicate if the file is compatible with SPPAS automatic
annotations:

- Green color: the value is perfectly matching the expectations;
- Orange color: the value is not the expected one but automatic annotations 
  will be able to convert it to the right one;
- Red color: none of the automatic annotations can work with the given value.
  The file must be modified.


### Playing audio files

The following shortcuts can be used:

- TAB: Play
- ESC: Stop
- F6: Rewind
- F7: Pause
- F8: Next


### Want more?

`AudioRoamer` allows to display a large amount of information for each channel.
For a long audio file, it can take a while to estimate such information... 
For example, a mono-audio file of 243 seconds (21.5Mb) is loaded in 20 seconds.
**So be patient! It's worth it!**

There are 3 main columns of information, related to amplitude, clipping and 
volume.

At the bottom of the window, it is possible to click on buttons to:

1. Save the channel currently displayed;
2. Save a portion (from...to...) of the channel;
3. Save the displayed information in a text file;
4. Close the window.


#### Amplitude

The amplitude is a variable characterizing the sinusoidal oscillation of the
digital-audio recording. It gives the deflection of a physical quantity from 
its neutral position (zero point) up to a positive or negative value.
With sound waves, it is the extent to which air particles are displaced, and 
this amplitude of sound or sound amplitude is experienced as the loudness of 
sound. The loudness perception of a sound is determined by the amplitude of 
the sound waves âˆ’ the higher the amplitude, the louder the sound or the noise.

The first column of `AudioRoamer` Data Manager gives amplitude values of each 
channel of the PCM file:

- Number of frames: the number of samples, i.e. the number of amplitude values;
- Min/Max values: minimum and maximum amplitude values in the channel;
- Zero crossings: number of times continuous values are crossing the 0 value.

The 5 information below can be modified and modifications can be saved 
separately for each channel:

- Frame rate: the sampling frequency observed in the channel is included in the
  default list of possible values. If it is modified, the color is changed.
- Samp. width: the bit depth observed in the channel is included in the list of 
  possible values. If it is modified, the color is changed.
- Multiply values by: all samples in the original channel are multiplied by the 
  floating-point value factor. Sample values are truncated in case of overflow.
- Add bias value: a bias value is added to each sample. Sample values wrap 
  around in case of overflow.
- Remove offset value: the average over all values is deduced to each sample. 
  Sample values wrap around in case of overflow.


#### Clipping

The second column displays the clipping rates of the sample values given a 
factor. It will consider that all values outside the interval are clipped.
The clipping rate is given as a percentage related to the total number of
values.
For example, if factor is 0.5 and clipping rate is 10%, it means that 10%
of the amplitude values are more than the half of the maximum amplitude.
This value is generally an expected rate while preparing audio recordings.


#### Volume

##### RMS:

Volume is estimated with root-mean-square (RMS) of the samples, i.e. 
sqrt(sum(S_i^2)/n). This is a measure of the power in an audio signal.
Between parenthesis, the volume in dB is estimated as: 20.log10(rms).
Doubling of the rms value leads to an increase of 6.02dB.

##### Automatic detection of silences:

Finally, the result of an automatic detection of silences is given. 
This information is given for information only: It is estimated with default
parameters which should be adapted!

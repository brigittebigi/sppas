## What is SPPAS?

### Overview

*SPPAS - the automatic annotation and analyses of speech* is a scientific 
computer software package written and maintained by Brigitte Bigi of
the [Laboratoire Parole et Langage](http://www.lpl-aix.fr).
SPPAS is daily developed with the aim to provide a robust and reliable
software. Available for free, with open source code, there is simply no other
package for linguists to simple use in both the automatic annotations of
speech and the analyses of any kind of annotated data.
You can imagine the annotations or analyses you need, SPPAS does the rest!
It doesn't do? Send your suggestion to the author!

Annotating recordings is very labor-intensive and cost-ineffective since it
has to be performed manually by experienced researchers with many hours 
of work. As the primary functionality, SPPAS proposes a set of **automatic or 
semi-automatic annotations of recordings**. 
In the present context, annotations are "defined as the practice of adding
interpretative, linguistic information to an electronic corpus of spoken and/or
written language data. 'Annotation' can also refer to the end-product of this
process" (Leech, 1997). 
SPPAS can then automatize annotations and allows users to save time.
In order to be used efficiently, SPPAS expects a rigorous methodology to 
collect data and to prepare them.
Automatic annotations of SPPAS can be used either with a Command-line User 
Interface or a Graphical User Interface. So, there's no specific difficulty
by using this software. Advanced users can also access directly the 
Application Programming Interface - API.

Linguistics annotation, especially when dealing with multiple domains, 
makes use of different tools within a given project. This implies a rigorous 
annotation framework to ensure compatibilities between annotations and time-saving. 
SPPAS annotation files are in a specific XML format with extension `xra`. 
**Annotations can be imported from and exported to a variety of other formats**
including Praat (TextGrid, PitchTier, IntensityTier), Elan (eaf), 
Transcriber (trs), Annotation Pro (antx), Phonedit (mrk), Sclite (ctm, stm), 
HTK (lab, mlf), subtitles formats (srt, sub), CSV files...

"[...] when multiple annotations are integrated into a single data set, 
inter-relationships between the annotations can be explored both qualitatively
(by using database queries that combine levels) and quantitatively 
(by running statistical analyses or machine learning algorithms)" 
(Chiarcos 2008). As a consequence, the annotations must be time-synchronized:
annotations need to be time-aligned in order to be useful for purposes such
as analyses. Some special features are offered in SPPAS for **managing 
annotated files and analyzing data**. Among others, it includes 
a tool to filter multi-levels annotations (Bigi and Saubesty, 2015). Other 
included tools are to estimate descriptive statistics, a version of the Time 
Group Analyzer (Gibbon 2013), manage annotated files, manage audio files, etc.
These data analysis tools of SPPAS are mainly proposed in the Graphical User 
Interface. However, advanced users can also access directly the Application 
Programming Interface, for example to estimate statistics or to manipulate
annotated data.

### User engagement

By using SPPAS, **you agree to cite a reference in your publications**.
All references are listed in Chapter 7 of this documentation.


### Need help

1. Many problems can be solved by updating the version of SPPAS.

2. When looking for more detail about some subject, one can search this
documentation. This documentation is available in-line - see the SPPAS website,
it is also included in the package in PDF format.

3. There is a F.A.Q. in the SPPAS web site. Topics can range from elementary 
"how do I" queries to advanced issues in scriptwriting. There's (or there will 
be) something there for everybody. 

4. If none of the above helps, you may contact the author by e-mail. 
Another option is that you may send e-mail to the author. 
In both cases, it is very important to indicate clearly:

    1. your operating system and its version,
    2. the version of SPPAS (supposed to be the last one), and
    3. for automatic annotations, send the log file, and a sample of the data
    on which a problem occurs.

class TimePoint(Time):
    """ Represents a time point identified by a time value.
        Generally, time is represented in seconds, as a float value.

        TimePoint relations are based on relations described in:
        Marc Vilain, Henry Kautz, Peter van Beek
        "Constraint Propagation Algorithms: A revised report"
        in: Readings in qualitative reasoning about physical systems
        Pages 373 - 381

        ISBN:1-55860-095-7 

        Citation: 
        Time points can modelled by the real numbers, and their relations
        can be entirely expressed as inequalities. [...] these relations
        can be decomposed into disjunctions of simple relations, which in 
        this case number three: <, = and >.
        Seven consistent vectors can be formed: (<), (=), (>), (<=), (=>),
        (<=>) and (<>). 


        In the TimePoint instance, the 3 relations <, = and > take into
        account a radius value. For a point x, with a radius value
        of dx, and a point y with a radius value of dy, these relations
        are defined as:
            - x = y iff |x - y| <= dx + dy
            - x < y iff not(x = y) and x < y
            - x > y iff not(x = y) and x > y

        Examples:

            Strictly equals:

            x = 1.000, dx=0.
            y = 1.000, dy=0.
            x = y is true

            x = 1.00000000000, dx=0.
            y = 0.99999999675, dy=0.
            x = y is false

            Accept a "margin":

            x = 1.0000000000, dx=0.0005
            y = 1.0000987653, dx=0.0005
            x = y is true  (accept a margin of 1ms between x and y)

            x = 1.0000000, dx=0.0005
            y = 1.0011235, dx=0.0005
            x = y is false 

        The vectors of Vilain et al. are implemented by using python
        comparisons:
            - <     lower than
            - ==    equal
            - >     greater than
            - <=    lesser or equal than
            - >=    greater or equal than
            - !=    different (i.e. not equal)
            - ? (TODO)
        Pay attention that, in the TimePoint instance, these relations 
        take into account the radius. This means that to strictly 
        compare 2 TimePoint instances, the radius must be fixed to 0.
        The default is to use a radius value of 0.0005 (this means 1/2 ms).

# This is the default configuration for intsint.  It is a rather
# simple text file, so please follow the following guidelines :)
# Any line that begins with a comment is ignored - add as many as you
# like. Note that an in-line comment is not supported.  If a line
# consists of whitespace only (tabs, spaces, carriage return), it will be
# ignored, so you can space control fields as you like.  ANYTHING ELSE
# IS PARSED!!  This means that lines with stray characters or lines that
# use non # comment characters will be interpreted

# Internal usage:
# Fix an id (without special chars)
identifier: intsint

# Fix the annotation step name
name: INTSINT

# Fix the resources (for language-dependent steps)
resources_path:  None
resources_type:  None
resources_name:  None
resources_ext:   None


# Fix the list of options:

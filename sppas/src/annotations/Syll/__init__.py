    This package deals with the syllabification annotation.

    The syllabification of phonemes is performed with a rule-based system.
    This RBS phoneme-to-syllable segmentation system is based on 2 main
    principles:
        - a syllable contains a vowel, and only one.
        - a pause is a syllable boundary.
    These two principles focus the problem of the task of finding a syllabic
    boundary between two vowels.
    As in state-of-the-art systems, phonemes were grouped into classes and
    rules established to deal with these classes.

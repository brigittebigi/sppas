"""
This package contains a set of classes dealing with the IPUs segmentation
annotation step. IPUs - Inter-Pausal Units - are blocks of speech bounded
by silent pauses.

The "IPUs segmentation" automatic annotation can perform 3 actions:

1. find silence/speech segmentation of a recorded file,
2. find silence/speech segmentation of a recorded file including
   the time-alignment of utterances of a transcription file,
3. split/save a recorded file into multiple files, depending on IPUs
   indicated in a time-aligned file.

    This package contains a set of classes dealing with the IPUs segmentation.
    IPUs - Inter-Pausal Units - are blocks of speech bounded by silent pauses.

    The "IPUs segmentation" automatic annotation can perform 3 actions:

    1. find silence/speech segmentation of a recorded file,
    2. find silence/speech segmentation of a recorded file including
       the time-alignment of utterances of a transcription file,
    3. split/save a recorded file into multiple files, depending on IPUs
       indicated in a time-aligned file.

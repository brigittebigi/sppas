`Visualizer` displays speech files and annotated files, and is very useful 
to take a nice screenshot.

This tool is still under-development, some "troubles/crashes" can occur 
while using it... however the data will never been corrupted!

When a file is checked on the file of files, it is opened and displayed in the
currently opened tab of the notebook. There is not limit on the number of audio 
files that can be displayed nor on the number of annotated files. To select a 
displayed file, click anywhere of the displayed part.

## Vizualizer

This component is still under-development, some "troubles/crashes" can occur 
while using it... but the data will never been corrupted!!

`Vizualizer` displays speech files and annotated files, and is very useful 
to take a nice screenshot! 
Most of the screenshots of annotated data of this document were taken with it...

#### Pronunciation dictionary

*GNU Public License*

The catalan pronunciation dictionary was downloaded from the Ralf catalog
of dictionaries for the Simon ASR system at
<http://spirit.blau.in/simon/import-pls-dictionary/>.
It was then converted (format and phoneset) by Brigitte Bigi.
Some new words were also added and phonetized manually (thank you Eva!).
New entries were then added from observed pronunciations in Glissando corpus.

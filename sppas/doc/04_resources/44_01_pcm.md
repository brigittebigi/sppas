### Pronunciation Dictionary

The dictionary was originally created by extracting the lexicon of the corpus
published in annex of (Deuber 2005). New words with their orthographic variants 
and pronunciations were added to the dictionary by team of four transcribers, 
native speakers of the language.

### Acoustic Model

The Naija acoustic model was created by Brigitte Bigi with the 
SPPAS training scripts.

An initial model was created on the basis of other language prototypes.
Such prototypes were mostly extracted from the English acoustic model.
For the missing models of phonemes, the nasals /O~/, /a~/, /e~/, 
/i~/ and /u~/ were picked off Southern Min language, and /E~/ was extracted 
from French language using /U~/ prototype. The vowels /a/ and /e/ were extracted
from the French model; and finally /O/ and /o/ from the Italian one. 
The fillers were also added to the model in order to be automatically 
time-aligned too: silence, noise, laughter.

The acoustic model was then trained with a set of 8 files (totalling 3 min 29 
seconds in length.) manually phonetized and time-aligned.
